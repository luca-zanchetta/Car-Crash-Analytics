## Introduction

Welcome to **Car Crash Analytics**! This is a web application implementing a simple visualization tool that helps our intended users - mainly driving school instructors - to enhance driving safety. 

Road accidents pose significant risks to public safety and incur substantial economic costs. Analyzing
accident data is crucial for understanding the underlying causes and patterns to devise effective
interventions. This repository presents **Car Crash Analytics**, a visualization tool designed to analyze
car accident data for promoting driving safety, particularly aimed at driving school instructors. The
tool offers an interactive interface featuring geographical map, scatterplot, heatmap, and parallel
coordinates charts to identify patterns, trends, and potential risk factors associated with road accidents.
Through data pre-processing and visualization techniques, users can explore insights such as safer
areas and conditions for driving lessons. The toolâ€™s capabilities empower instructors to make informed
decisions and contribute to reducing road accidents through evidence-based strategies. While offering
valuable insights, the tool also presents opportunities for further enhancements and collaboration with
stakeholders to advance road safety initiatives.

The architecture of the application is composed of a single **frontend** node, that is based on a **NodeJS** development server and on the **ReactJS** framework. All the system is able to run on-premise: see the [Installation and Launch](#installation-and-launch) section for further details. The whole application is based on the [**Car Accident Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nextmillionaire/car-accident-dataset/data), which is a dataset providing detailed records of road accidents that
occurred during January 2021 in Kensington and Chelsea. It includes information such as the accident date, day of the
week, junction control, accident severity, geographical coordinates, lighting and weather conditions, vehicle details, and
more. The data is valuable for analyzing and understanding the factors contributing to road accidents in this urban area,
aiding in the development of strategies for improved road safety.

We strongly recommend users to have a look at our [report](https://github.com/luca-zanchetta/Car-Crash-Analytics/blob/main/Report.pdf) before the first launch of the application.
